# Pharma_Ex - Availability Checker for Medicines

As part of my 2nd-year university mini project conducted under the Rapid Application Development course module, I led a team in developing Pharma EX, an innovative pharmaceutical inventory management system.

Technologies Used:

-Front-end Development: JavaFX
-Back-end Development: Java, Hibernate, JDBC for Database Connectivity

Key Features:

User Roles: Admin, Customer, Sales Rep, Pharmacists

-Admin Responsibilities:
	-Manage pharmacies, pharmacists, and sales reps through a review process.

-Sales Rep Responsibilities:
	-Search inventories in pharmacies.
	-Schedule next dispatch dates to pharmacies for efficient inventory management.

-Pharmacist Responsibilities:
	-Add, edit, and delete drugs within their pharmacies.
	-Monitor available and unavailable drug stocks.

-Customer-Focused Functionality:
	-Customers can create accounts in the system
	-Customers can search for specific drugs and find their availability across pharmacies.
	-If a drug is unavailable, the system suggests alternative drugs, ensuring customer satisfaction.

Impact:

-Streamlined pharmaceutical inventory management for enhanced efficiency.
-Improved customer experience by providing real-time information on drug availability and alternatives.
-Enabled pharmacies to optimize stock levels and reduce the risk of stockouts.

This project exemplifies my proficiency in JavaFX for creating an intuitive front end and leveraging Java and JDBC for robust back-end functionality. It also showcases my ability to design solutions that address real-world challenges within the pharmaceutical domain.
